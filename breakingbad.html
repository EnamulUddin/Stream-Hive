  <h3>BREAKING BAD</h3>
  <p>
Breaking Bad is a gripping crime drama that follows the transformation of Walter White, a quiet and brilliant high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who turns to a life of crime after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Determined to secure his family’s financial future, Walt partners with his former student Jesse Pinkman to produce and sell high-quality methamphetamine. What begins as a desperate act soon evolves into a dangerous obsession with power, control, and legacy. As Walt adopts the alias “Heisenberg” and climbs the ranks of the drug world, he becomes increasingly ruthless, manipulating, lying, and killing to protect his empire. Alongside him, Jesse struggles with guilt, addiction, and the moral weight of their actions. The series masterfully explores themes of morality, identity, pride, and consequence as Walt’s dual life threatens to destroy everyone around him, including his wife Skyler, his DEA agent brother-in-law Hank, and Jesse himself. With intense storytelling, complex characters, and escalating stakes, *Breaking Bad* is a dark, thrilling journey of a man who breaks bad and becomes unrecognizable from the person he once was.

<div class="description-box">
  <h3>SEASON 1</h3>
  <p>
Breaking Bad begins with Walter White, a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Faced with mounting medical bills and the fear of leaving his family with nothing, Walt partners with former student Jesse Pinkman to manufacture and sell methamphetamine. Walt’s descent into the criminal underworld starts slowly, as he balances his secret life with his duties as a husband and father. Using his scientific knowledge, he creates a pure and powerful product that catches the attention of local dealers. Tensions rise as Walt's double life becomes harder to conceal, and a confrontation with a violent distributor sets the stage for the darker path he is beginning to take.
  </p>
   <h3>SEASON 2</h3>
  <p>
Walt and Jesse’s operation expands, but so do the consequences of their actions. They secure a distribution deal with Tuco Salamanca, a volatile drug dealer, but their alliance quickly spirals into chaos. Tuco’s unpredictability leads to a violent end, forcing Walt and Jesse to rethink their strategy. Meanwhile, Walt’s wife, Skyler, grows increasingly suspicious of his erratic behavior and secretive activities. Jesse begins a relationship with Jane Margolis, whose influence draws him into addiction. The season culminates in a devastating tragedy when Jane dies of an overdose and a grief-stricken air traffic controller, her father, causes a midair collision. The ripple effects of Walt’s decisions become clearer as his moral boundaries continue to erode.
   </p>
   <h3>SEASON 3</h3>
  <p>
Walt tries to distance himself from the drug trade, but the allure of money and control pulls him back in when Gus Fring, a calm and calculated drug kingpin, offers him a state-of-the-art meth lab and a lucrative partnership. Jesse struggles with guilt over Jane’s death and begins to spiral, but eventually rejoins Walt in the new operation. Tensions mount as Walt’s wife discovers the full truth about his meth business and demands a divorce, while his DEA agent brother-in-law Hank intensifies his pursuit of Albuquerque’s meth kingpin, unaware it is Walt himself. A deadly threat emerges in the form of the Cousins, cartel enforcers sent to kill Walt as revenge for Tuco’s death, escalating the stakes and forcing Gus to make strategic moves to protect his investment in Walt.
   </p>
   <h3>SEASON 4</h3>
  <p>
Walt and Jesse's alliance with Gus becomes increasingly strained as they both realize that Gus is planning to replace Walt with a more compliant cook. Walt grows increasingly paranoid and desperate, using manipulation and deception to protect himself. Jesse becomes a pawn in the power struggle, gaining Gus’s trust while still secretly loyal to Walt. Meanwhile, Hank’s investigation into the meth empire narrows, drawing closer to Gus. The season builds to a tense and explosive finale, as Walt and Jesse orchestrate Gus’s assassination using a bomb hidden on Hector Salamanca’s wheelchair. Gus’s death marks Walt’s transformation from a desperate man into a powerful and ruthless criminal mastermind, willing to destroy anyone in his path.
   </p>
   <h3>SEASON 5</h3>
  <p>
 The final season is divided into two parts, chronicling Walt’s rise and fall. With Gus out of the way, Walt takes over the meth empire, building an international distribution network and amassing a vast fortune. However, power breeds arrogance, and Walt’s actions become increasingly reckless. Jesse becomes disillusioned and distances himself, while Skyler is consumed by fear and guilt. Hank eventually discovers that Walt is Heisenberg, triggering a cat-and-mouse game that leads to a violent showdown. Walt’s empire collapses when he is exposed, forcing him to go on the run. In the final episodes, Walt returns to Albuquerque to tie up loose ends, rescue Jesse from captivity, and take revenge on those who betrayed him. In a climactic ending, Walt dies in a final act of redemption, leaving behind a shattered family and a legacy of destruction.
